proof of concept usv thing

take; std bad still and serialation need a good type foundation for recursive templates to actaully handle complex types

I think writing a std from strach would be easier then running down all the edge cases from std.to having failures, std.meta being wierd about strings, random auto decoding things srpinked thruout the std etc. etc. etc.
